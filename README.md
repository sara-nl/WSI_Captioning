# Requirements

Install the requirements in ```requirements.txt```.
 
This repo needs a contrastive whole slide image diagnostic report model trained on whole slide images and diagnostic reports. Additionally, the repo requires extracted WSI embeddings, Bio-GPT-2 embeddings and extracted PubmedBERT LM tokens. If you require access to these data, please mail ```bryan.cardenasguevara@surf.nl```.

# Run 

run

```
sh train_captioning.sh
```

This trains the model but does not evaluate it during training apart from computing the validation loss.
